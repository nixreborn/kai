## Deployment Checklist

### 1. Docker Deployment

```bash
# Start services
cd /home/nix/projects/kai
docker compose up -d

# Wait for services to be healthy
docker compose ps

# Check logs
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs redis
```

- [ ] All services started successfully
- [ ] Backend connected to Redis
- [ ] Backend connected to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Health check passes

### 2. Database Migration

```bash
# Run migrations
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head

# Verify indexes
docker compose exec postgres psql -U kai -d kai_db -c "\d+ journal_entries"
```

- [ ] Migration executed successfully
- [ ] Indexes created on `journal_entries.created_at`
- [ ] Indexes created on `conversations.created_at`
- [ ] Composite indexes created

### 3. Verification

```bash
# Test basic health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test detailed health
curl http://localhost:8000/health/detailed

# Run verification script
docker compose exec backend python scripts/verify_performance.py
```

- [ ] Basic health check returns 200
- [ ] Redis status is "healthy"
- [ ] Database status is "healthy"
- [ ] Performance metrics are available
- [ ] Verification script passes all checks

### 4. Performance Testing

```bash
# Test cache (first request - cache miss)
time curl "http://localhost:8000/api/journal/entries?user_id=test&page=1&page_size=20"

# Test cache (second request - cache hit)
time curl "http://localhost:8000/api/journal/entries?user_id=test&page=1&page_size=20"

# Check Redis cache
docker compose exec redis redis-cli KEYS "*"
```

- [ ] First request completes (slower, cache miss)
- [ ] Second request is faster (cache hit)
- [ ] Cache keys visible in Redis
- [ ] Response includes `X-Response-Time` header

### 5. Load Testing

```bash
# Install tools if needed
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install apache2-utils wrk
# macOS: brew install httpd wrk

# Test with Apache Bench
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:8000/health

# Test with wrk
wrk -t4 -c100 -d10s http://localhost:8000/health/detailed
```

- [ ] Load test completed without errors
- [ ] Response times are reasonable
- [ ] No connection errors
- [ ] System resources stable

## Production Readiness Checklist

# Production settings in .env
DEBUG=false
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
```

- [ ] `DEBUG` set to `false`

- [ ] Eviction policy set to `allkeys-lru`
- [ ] Persistence enabled (`appendonly yes`)
- [ ] Redis data volume configured

### 3. Database Configuration

- [ ] Connection pool size configured (default: 5)

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Service Health

```bash
# Check all services
curl http://localhost:8000/health/detailed | jq

# Expected output:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "database": {"status": "healthy"},
#   "redis": {"status": "healthy"},
#   "performance": {...}
# }
```

- [ ] Overall status is "healthy"
- [ ] Database response time < 10ms
- [ ] Redis response time < 5ms
- [ ] No errors in performance metrics

### 2. Cache Verification

```bash
# Monitor Redis operations
docker compose exec redis redis-cli MONITOR

# In another terminal, make requests
curl http://localhost:8000/api/journal/entries?user_id=test

# Check cache operations in MONITOR output
```

- [ ] Cache SET operations visible
- [ ] Cache GET operations visible
- [ ] TTL values correct
- [ ] Cache keys properly namespaced

### 3. Performance Metrics

```bash
# Get performance metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/health/detailed | jq '.performance.endpoints'
```

- [ ] Endpoint metrics collecting
- [ ] Average response times reasonable
- [ ] Error rates low (<1%)
- [ ] Slow queries logged if any

### 4. Response Optimization

```bash
# Check compression
curl -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" -I http://localhost:8000/api/journal/entries?user_id=test

# Should include:
# Content-Encoding: gzip
# X-Response-Time: 0.XXXXs
```

- [ ] Gzip compression active
- [ ] Response time header present
- [ ] Appropriate cache headers (if implemented)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks

- [ ] Health check endpoint status
- [ ] Redis memory usage
- [ ] Cache hit rate
- [ ] Slow query count

### Weekly Checks

- [ ] Cache eviction rate
- [ ] Database index usage
- [ ] Error rate analysis

### Monthly Checks

- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Cache strategy review
- [ ] Index optimization review

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, follow these steps:

### 1. Quick Rollback (Keep Redis, Remove Middleware)

```python
# Edit src/main.py, comment out:
# app.add_middleware(PerformanceMiddleware)
# app.add_middleware(CompressionMiddleware, minimum_size=500)

# Restart backend
docker compose restart backend
```

### 2. Full Rollback (Remove All Optimizations)

```bash
# Stop Redis
docker compose stop redis

# Rollback database migration
docker compose exec backend alembic downgrade -1

# Remove Redis from docker-compose.yml (comment out service)
# Remove REDIS_URL from .env

# Restart services
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Verify Rollback

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Verify no Redis dependency
# Should work without Redis running
```

## Troubleshooting Reference

### Redis Connection Issues

```bash
# Check Redis is running
docker compose ps redis

# Test connection
docker compose exec redis redis-cli ping

# Check logs
docker compose logs redis

# Verify environment variable
docker compose exec backend env | grep REDIS_URL
```

### Database Index Issues

```bash
# List all indexes
docker compose exec postgres psql -U kai -d kai_db -c "\di"

# Check specific table
docker compose exec postgres psql -U kai -d kai_db -c "\d+ journal_entries"

# Verify index usage
docker compose exec postgres psql -U kai -d kai_db -c "EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM journal_entries WHERE user_id = 'test' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

### Cache Not Working

```bash
# Check cache keys
docker compose exec redis redis-cli KEYS "*"

# Monitor cache operations
docker compose exec redis redis-cli MONITOR

# Check cache stats
docker compose exec redis redis-cli INFO stats

# Flush cache if needed
docker compose exec redis redis-cli FLUSHDB
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Check slow queries
docker compose logs backend | grep "Slow query"

# Check endpoint metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/health/detailed | jq '.performance'

# Monitor system resources
docker stats
```
