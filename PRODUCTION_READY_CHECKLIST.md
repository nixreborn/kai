  - Warning: Using class-based config instead of ConfigDict
  - Non-blocking but should be updated
  - Fix: Replace `class Config:` with `model_config = ConfigDict(...)`

- **FastAPI on_event deprecation** in `main.py` line 35
  - Warning: `@app.on_event("startup")` is deprecated
  - Non-blocking but should be updated
  - Fix: Use lifespan context manager instead

- [ ] Support team trained
- [ ] Incident response plan documented

### Production Readiness Score
- Code Quality: ✅ 95% (127/134 tests passing)
- Security: ⚠️ Needs review (update secrets, configure SSL)
- Infrastructure: ⚠️ Needs setup (database, LLM service)
- Testing: ⚠️ Needs completion (E2E tests with live services)
- Monitoring: ⚠️ Needs setup (alerts, logging)

**Current Status: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

**Blocking Items:**
1. LLM service endpoint must be configured and accessible
2. Production database must be set up and migrated
3. Security credentials must be updated (SECRET_KEY, etc.)
4. End-to-end testing with live services must be completed
5. Monitoring and alerting must be configured

**Estimated Time to Production Ready:**
- With dedicated LLM service: 1-2 days
- With monitoring setup: 0.5-1 day
- With E2E testing: 0.5-1 day
- **Total: 2-4 days**
