## Issues Found and Resolved

### Issue 1: SQLAlchemy Reserved Name Error

**Symptom**: Test collection failed with error about `metadata` column

**Cause**: `metadata` is a reserved attribute name in SQLAlchemy's declarative base

**File**: `src/models/database.py`, line 158

**Status**: RESOLVED ✓

### Issue 2: Python Environment

**Symptom**: Initial test run couldn't find openai module

**Cause**: Tests run outside uv virtual environment

**Fix**: Used `uv run pytest` instead of direct `pytest`
